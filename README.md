# Bust a Shape

A collaborative, real-time tool for creating artwork in the browser. Inspired by [@afragon](https://twitter.com/afragon)'s work with [CSS live coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrYOnQTXWzs) ([see a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztwSAZ7lJg8))

An experiment by [Chris Ruppel](https://github.com/rupl) and [Afra Noubarzadeh](https://github.com/afragon).

## Installation and Setup

Assuming you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, just run the following commands:

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
```

Now use gulp to run the server:

```
gulp start
```

Open any number of browsers, point them at http://localhost:3000, and have fun!

## Multiplayer art

A hosted version is coming! But for now, local development will have to do.
