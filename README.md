# Socket Art

A collaborative, real-time tool for creating artwork in the browser. Inspired by [Afra Noubarzadeh](https://github.com/afragon)'s work with [CSS live coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrYOnQTXWzs) ([see a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztwSAZ7lJg8))

An experiment by [Chris Ruppel](https://github.com/rupl)

## Installation and Setup

Assuming you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, just run the following commands:

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
```

Now use gulp to run the server:

```
gulp start
```

Open any number of browsers, point them at http://localhost:3000, and have fun!

## Multiplayer art

Once this is a little more developed I'd like to put it online. But for now, local development will have to do.
